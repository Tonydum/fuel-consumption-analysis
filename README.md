# Fuel Consumption Optimization Analysis

## Introduction

In the quest for sustainability and economic efficiency, optimizing fuel consumption is of paramount importance. This project delves into the intricate details of vehicle fuel consumption over two decades, from 2000 to 2022, leveraging historical data to extract meaningful patterns, determine causative factors, and propose optimization strategies.

## Objective

The project's goal is to harness historical vehicle data to uncover the determinants of fuel consumption, thereby enabling informed recommendations for enhancing fuel efficiency.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset encompasses a range of variables pivotal to understanding fuel consumption dynamics:

- `YEAR`: The model year of the vehicle.
- `MAKE`: The vehicle's manufacturer.
- `MODEL`: The specific model of the vehicle.
- `VEHICLE CLASS`: The classification of the vehicle, e.g., Compact, SUV.
- `ENGINE SIZE`: The size of the engine in liters.
- `CYLINDERS`: The engine's cylinder count.
- `TRANSMISSION`: The type of vehicle transmission.
- `FUEL TYPE`: The category of fuel used.
- `FUEL CONSUMPTION`: Measured in city and highway (L/100 km) and combined.
- `CO2 EMISSIONS`: The vehicle's emissions in grams per kilometer.

## Methodology

### SQL Analysis

Structured Query Language (SQL) served as the cornerstone for initial data extraction and analysis, revealing:

- Trends in fuel consumption over the years.
- Comparative fuel efficiency across various vehicle classes.
- A detailed examination of CO2 emissions corresponding with fuel consumption trends.

### Python Analysis

With Python and libraries such as Pandas and SciPy, we performed:

- Data cleaning and integrity checks.
- Statistical analysis, including the calculation of the Pearson correlation coefficient between engine size and fuel consumption.

## Key Findings

- A significant positive correlation (r = 0.807) was found between engine size and fuel consumption.
- Fuel consumption has seen a general decrease until 2014, followed by a slight rise.
- Different vehicle classes show substantial variation in fuel consumption.
- CO2 emissions trends closely follow the patterns observed in fuel consumption.

## Conclusions

The study confirms that technological advancements significantly impacted fuel efficiency gains until 2014. Engine size is a strong predictor of fuel consumption, thus a vital consideration for vehicle design and purchase.

## Recommendations

- **Manufacturers**: Focus on the innovation of smaller, more efficient engines.
- **Policy Makers**: Incentivize the acquisition of vehicles with better fuel efficiency metrics.
- **Consumers**: Prioritize engine size as a critical criterion for fuel economy when selecting a vehicle.

## Future Work

The scope for future research includes:

- Investigating the effects of emerging technologies like electric and hybrid vehicles on fuel consumption patterns.
- Analyzing the influence of global economic factors and public policies on fuel efficiency trends.

## Conclusion

Embracing a data-centric approach not only paves the way for enhanced fuel efficiency but also contributes to the collective goal of environmental conservation. Through the findings of this analysis, stakeholders are equipped with actionable insights to make progress towards a more fuel-efficient future.
